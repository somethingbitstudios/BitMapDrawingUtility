# BitMapDrawingUtility
The BitMapDrawingUtility(name not final), is a client-side bit map web application made primarily for editing pixel art. 
Planned features:
Dynamic color palette mode: when a color in the color palette changes, the corresponding pixels change as well
pseudo 3d rotation of 2d planes
frame by frame animation
Currently a work in progress.
